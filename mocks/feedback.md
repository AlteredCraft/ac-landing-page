## Feedback

- Dan: I like Minimal
- Miranda: Font on Minimal, but colors in the Bold.
- Jin: I prefer the bold look as it quickly grabs my attention and drives home this is associate with AI guidance.
  Part of it is about the personality you want to convey though
  The first one gives a more relaxed feel that I like but if you go with that I would find a way to punch up the ai text a little.
- Megan: Minimal Feels more approachable. The font on Bold gave me an immediate negative feeling. like I actually shirked back a little bit LOLOL
- Adam: i like the "impact" Bold has, imo it leaves a better first impression
- Alex: I prefer option Minimal, the font is too heavy on Bold for my taste
- Andrew: prefer Bold as it flows better
- Max: The header font on Bold is too intense
